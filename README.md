# Breast Cancer Classification - Team 5G

The objective of this project is to create a breast cancer prediction model using the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagonistic dataset in order to categorize observations from a breast cancer image into benign or malignant, comparing the use of a **Decision Tree model** vs. a **Logistic Regression model** in Python. Using an accurate breast cancer prediction model can help support and guide doctors in providing better, quicker care to their patients during critical times or when patient volume is high. 

**üìÅ File**
* `Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Team_5G.ipynb`: Complete notebook including data preprocessing, visualizations, model training, and evaluation.

**üìä Dataset**
* **Source**: UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset  
* **Samples**: 570 rows
* **Features**: 33 columns (30 feature measurements + diagnosis + ID + unnamed column)
* **Target**: Diagnosis (`M` = malignant, `B` = benign)
* **Class Distribution**: 
  * Malignant (1): 212 cases (37%)
  * Benign (0): 357 cases (63%)
* **Feature Types**: 10 characteristics measured in 3 ways (mean, standard error, worst values)
* **Data Source**: Features computed from digitized image of Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) of breast mass

**üîç Key Findings**
* **Top Predictors**: Concave points, radius, perimeter
* **Weakest Predictors**: Fractal dimension, symmetry
* **Best Model**: Logistic Regression with **95.614% accuracy**
* **Clinical Impact**: Model gives correct diagnosis in 95 out of 100 cases
* **Early Detection Benefit**: Can increase survival rate from 27% to 99% through early detection

**üõ†Ô∏è Libraries Used**
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `scikit-learn`
* `tensor-flow`
* `keras`

**üöÄ Methodology**

**Data Preprocessing:**
1. Converted diagnosis column from categorical (M,B) to numerical values (1,0)
2. Dropped unnecessary columns (ID and NaN-only columns)
3. Applied data scaling for model optimization
4. Train-test split (80% training, 20% testing)

**Model Development:**
1. **Correlation Analysis**: Identified strongest and weakest predictors
2. **Model Training**: Implemented Decision Tree and Logistic Regression
3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Used grid-search technique for parameter tuning
4. **Model Evaluation**: Compared performance using accuracy metrics

**üìà Results**

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Decision Tree | 94.736% |
| **Logistic Regression** | **95.614%** |

**üéØ Clinical Significance**
Our best model achieved **95.6% accuracy**, meaning that in a clinical setting, the model provides a correct diagnosis in **95 out of 100 cases**. This model could:
- Prevent misdiagnosis in thousands of cases every year
- Provide faster diagnostic support
- Increase average survival rate from 27% to 99% through **early detection**
